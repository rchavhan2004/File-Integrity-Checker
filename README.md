  <strong>🛡 Verify File Integrity Using SHA-256 Hashing</strong>
</p>

---

## ⚡ Overview

The **SHA-256 File Integrity Checker** is a simple yet effective tool that computes SHA-256 hashes of files to verify their integrity. It helps detect any unauthorized modifications by comparing hash values.

- ✅ Compute SHA-256 hash for files
- ✅ Verify file integrity in a directory
- ✅ Detect changes in files using hashing

---

## 🛠 Features

- 🔑 **SHA-256 Hash Calculation** for files
- 📂 **Directory-Wide Integrity Check**
- 🛡 **Detection of Unauthorized File Changes**
- 🌍 **Cross-platform Compatibility**

---

## 🧩 How It Works

### 🔍 SHA-256 Hash Calculation

1. **File Selection**: The user provides a file or directory path.
2. **Hash Computation**: The program reads the file in chunks and computes its SHA-256 hash.
3. **Integrity Verification**: The computed hash can be compared against a previously known hash.

### 📂 Directory Integrity Check

1. **User Inputs Directory Path**: The program scans all files in the directory.
2. **Computes SHA-256 Hash**: Each file’s hash is calculated and displayed.
3. **Detects Changes**: If a file has been modified, its hash will not match the previous value.
